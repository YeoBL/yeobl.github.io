# SCTF 2025 Training Challs Writeups

## General remarks

I set a few of the training challenges for SCTF 2025. The challenges were intended to be as beginner-friendly as possible, to ensure accessibility even for those new to Crypto or CTFs in general.

Here are the challs I set/ported over (from picoCTF) and their writeups:

1. [Baby RSA](#baby-rsa)
2. [Baby Diffie Hellman](#baby-diffie-hellman)
3. [Baby Ciphers](#baby-ciphers)
4. Baby Math
5. [picoCTF 2022 - bloat.py (modified)](#picoctf-2022---bloatpy-modified)
6. [picoCTF 2023 - timer](#picoctf-2023---timer)

## Baby RSA

### Description

RSA is a widely used public key cryptosystem. In this challenge, you will be given a public key and a ciphertext. Can you decrypt the ciphertext and find the flag?

Files Provided:

- [values.txt](/media/SCTF25/values.txt)

### Writeup

First, let's start by understanding how RSA works.

Let's say Alice wants to create a channel for Bob to send encrypted messages to her that no one else can read. She goes through this process:

#### Key Generation (code sameple below)

1. Alice selects two large prime numbers, $p$ and $q$
2. She computes $N = p \cdot q$, $N$ will serve as the _modulus_ for our encryption later on
3. Alice calculates the [Euler's Totient Function](https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-totient-function/) of $N$ with the formula $\phi (N) = (p - 1) \cdot (q- 1)$; this works since the prime factorization of $N$ is $p \cdot q$
4. Considering $\phi(n)$, Alice chooses some $e$ s.t. $gcd(N, e) = 1$; it becomes obvious why the aforementioned condition must hold later on in our **decryption** process
5. Alice gives the public key pair, $(N, e)$, to Bob

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime

# === Step 1 === 
p = getPrime(512)
q = getPrime(512)

# === Step 2 ===
N = p * q

# === Step 3 ===
phi_N = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

# === Step 4 ===
e = 0x10001

print(f"{p = }")
print(f"{q = }")
print(f"{N = }")
print(f"{phi_N = }")

# Output:
# p = 11996598273605636145069419593205005846975886031384924121525649872736600857931317463826741254540229918836213397425790401377065109199078890777034271748352803
# q = 11529332781459115465320542363273346403758998590779750801735045957912871132251628344661856090782819674759143792781986640386149201540006310809153803808787383
# N = 138312773741877291672357397663809010934140453857971665783406363279809934372759262739011787973458255321308759704546691267715470612972075635684713198071066863926094313139733670436026979253138676514853751406467734056724479988541636788408198686566031787831322699142635868515592233916796854802444681820907099084549
# phi_N = 138312773741877291672357397663809010934140453857971665783406363279809934372759262739011787973458255321308759704546691267715470612972075635684713198071066840400163258074982060046065022774786425779969129241792810796028649339069646605462390197968686464781729103785445660738550470702486115717243095632831541944364
```

Now, Bob has received the public key pair, $(N,e)$. He follows these steps to encrypt a secret message, $msg$

#### Encryption (code sample below)

1. Bob converts his message, $msg$ to an integer, $pt$; we can use python's `pycryptodome` library to do this
2. Next, he encrypts $pt$ into $ct$ with the formula $ct \equiv pt^{e} \space (mod \space N)$; `e=0x1001` is a common choice of $e$
3. Bob sends $ct$ to Alice, for her to decrypt

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import bytes_to_long
# run `pip install pycryptodome` if it is not currently installed

e = 0x10001
N = 138312773741877291672357397663809010934140453857971665783406363279809934372759262739011787973458255321308759704546691267715470612972075635684713198071066863926094313139733670436026979253138676514853751406467734056724479988541636788408198686566031787831322699142635868515592233916796854802444681820907099084549

msg = "hello, this is a secret message"
pt = bytes_to_long(msg.encode('UTF-8'))

ct = pow(pt, e, N)
print(f"{ct = }")

# ct = 66590078406431864155269238127192115295609648732772441452460501772391677180014077326200367705353791761442972311060357397439413829674643507788438343205587828559626302284973767398769362935501215148162207076851993424099823386066052328564997084130299315404076623317020097274086180469642150794534311465381986880107
```

Even if an eavesdropper, Eve, somehow intercepts the message $ct$, she will not be able to decrypt it into $pt$ if it is properly encrypted.

#### Decryption (code sample below)

1. Alice computes $d \equiv e^{-1} \space (mod \space \phi (N))$
2. Using the formula $ct^{d} \equiv pt \space (mod \space N)$, Alice retrieves $pt$
3. Alice converts $pt$, an integer, back into string form; we can use python's `pycryptodome` library to do this

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
p = 11996598273605636145069419593205005846975886031384924121525649872736600857931317463826741254540229918836213397425790401377065109199078890777034271748352803
q = 11529332781459115465320542363273346403758998590779750801735045957912871132251628344661856090782819674759143792781986640386149201540006310809153803808787383
N = 138312773741877291672357397663809010934140453857971665783406363279809934372759262739011787973458255321308759704546691267715470612972075635684713198071066863926094313139733670436026979253138676514853751406467734056724479988541636788408198686566031787831322699142635868515592233916796854802444681820907099084549
e = 0x10001
ct = 66590078406431864155269238127192115295609648732772441452460501772391677180014077326200367705353791761442972311060357397439413829674643507788438343205587828559626302284973767398769362935501215148162207076851993424099823386066052328564997084130299315404076623317020097274086180469642150794534311465381986880107

phi_N = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

# === Step 1 ===
d = pow(e, -1, phi_N)

# === Step 2 === 
pt = pow(ct, d, N)

# === Step 3 === 
msg = long_to_bytes(pt).decode()

print(f"{msg = }")
```

You might ask, why does $ct^{d} \equiv pt \space (mod \space N)$ hold? To answer this, we need to take a look at [Euler's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem) which tells us that for any 2 coprime integers $(a, n)$, $a ^{\phi (n)} \equiv 1 \space (mod \space n)$

Here, $gcd(pt, N) = 1$ holds (it holds for > 99.999% values of $pt$, in fact, $\frac{\phi (N)}{N}$ values $\in [1, N)$ have a gcd of $1$). The corollary is that $pt^{\phi (N)} \equiv 1 \space (mod \space N)$.

By choosing $d \equiv e^{-1} \space (mod \space \phi (N))$, we get $e \cdot d \equiv 1 \space (mod \space \phi (N)) \Rightarrow e \cdot d = k \cdot \phi (N) + 1, k \in \mathbb{Z}$

Applying the aforementioned formula, we get 

$$
\begin{align*}
    ct^d & \equiv (pt ^ e) ^ d && \space (mod \space N) \\
         & \equiv pt ^ {e \cdot d} && \space (mod \space N) \\
         & \equiv pt ^ {k \cdot \phi(N) + 1} && \space (mod \space N) \\
         & \equiv pt ^ {k \cdot \phi(N)} \cdot pt && \space (mod \space N) \\
         & \equiv (pt ^ {\phi(N)}) ^ k \cdot pt && \space (mod \space N) \\
         & \equiv 1 ^ k \cdot pt && \space (mod \space N) \\
         & \equiv pt && \space (mod \space N) \\
\end{align*}
$$

#### Retrieving The Flag

Now that we know how RSA works, let's retrieve the flag with the values in the challenge:

```python
N = 138312773741877291672357397663809010934140453857971665783406363279809934372759262739011787973458255321308759704546691267715470612972075635684713198071066863926094313139733670436026979253138676514853751406467734056724479988541636788408198686566031787831322699142635868515592233916796854802444681820907099084549
e = 65537
p = 11996598273605636145069419593205005846975886031384924121525649872736600857931317463826741254540229918836213397425790401377065109199078890777034271748352803
ct = 23303902472439364601400610165551656518493821119047909723492875263500112136980783683129651013037950319957072514387924720844366993096123785590772579351718636839441852796582801406943584212307393739154583251209665140171544643625178410939109184344556283724001694711941795642330913723038598484869456343973132964577
```

Notice that we are not given $p$, but since we know that $N = p \cdot q$, we can simply calculate it:

```python
q = N // p
```

Next, we calculate $\phi (N) = (p - 1) \cdot (q -1)$

```python
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
```

Then we find $d \equiv e^{-1} \space (mod \space \phi (N))$

```python
d = pow(e, -1, phi)
```

We use $d$ to retrieve $pt$:

```python
pt = pow(ct, d, N)
```

Lastly we convert $pt$ into a string and print it:

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
# run `pip install pycryptodome` if it is not currently installed

flag = long_to_bytes(m).decode()
print(f"{flag = }")
```

## Baby Diffie Hellman

### Description

Diffie Hellman is a widely used private key cryptosystem. In this challenge, Alice has both her own private and public keys alongside Bobâ€™s public key. Can you help her decrypt the ciphertext and find the flag?

Files Provided:

- [source.py](/media/SCTF25/source2.py)

### Writeup

First, let's start by understanding how Diffie-Hellman works.

Suppose Alice and Bob want to create a shared key (for AES encryption whatsoever), but do not have a secure channel to exchange this key, due to the presence of Eve, an eavesdropper who can listen in to their communications. They go through the following process

#### Shared Key Generation (Code Sample Below)

1. Alice chooses some large prime $p$, and a generator, $g$, and broadcasts $(p, g)$ to Bob
2. Alice also chooses her own private key, $a \in [0, p)$, and generates her public key $A = g^a \space (mod \space p)$, and broadcasts her public key, $A$ to Bob
3. Bob chooses his own private key, $b \in [0, p)$, and generates his public key $B = g^b \space (mod \space p)$, and broadcasts his public key, $B$ to Alice. Now, both Alice and Bob have sufficient information to compute the shared key $S = g^{a \cdot b} \space (mod \space p)$
4. Alice has $a, A$ and $B$, and simply computes $S = B^{a} = g ^ {a \cdot b} \space (mod \space p)$
5. Bob has $b, B$ and $A$, and simply computes $S = A^{b} = g ^ {b \cdot a} \space (mod \space p)$

##### Note: Eve, the eavesdropper, only has $A$ and $B$, which are by themselves unable to compute $S$, unless $a$ or $b$ is trivially recoverable

```python
# === Step 1 ===
# N is our modulus
N = getPrime(1024)

# g is our generator
g = 2

# === Step 2 ===
# a and A are Alice's private and public keys respectively
a = randrange(1024, N)
A = pow(g, a, N)

# === Step 3 ===
# b and B are Bob's private and public keys respectively
b = randrange(1024, N)
B = pow(g, b, N)

# === Step 4 ===
# Alice computes the shared key using Bob's public key and her own private key
shared_key_alice = pow(B, a, N)

# === Step 5 ===
# Bob computes the shared key using Alice's public key and his own private key
shared_key_bob = pow(A, b, N)

# This should always return true, i.e. both shared keys should match
assert shared_key_alice == shared_key_bob 

# Now, Alice and Bob can use the shared key for symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES
# Eve, however, is unable to compute the shared key unless a or b are trivially recoverable
```

#### Retrieving The Flag

In this challenge, we are playing the role of Alice, and are given $a, A$ and $B$. Using the above formula, we simply calculate $S = B^{a} \space (mod \space n)$ and use the provided `decrypt_flag` function to decrypt the encoded flag.

[My solve script](/media/SCTF25/solve2.py).

## Baby Ciphers

### Description

I have split my flag into multiple parts and encrypted them with various techniques!

You will never be able to find the original flag!

Files Provided:

- [source.py](/media/SCTF25/source3.py)

### Writeup

In this challenge, our flag is split into 4 parts, then passed through some ciphers/base64 encoding.

```python
# Defining a flag of length 36, all letters are lowercase
flag = 'sctf{k3yl355_c1ph3rs_4r3_n0t_s3cur3}'

# Split the flag into 4 parts, each of equal length
part_length = len(flag) // 4
parts = [flag[part_length * x : part_length * (x + 1)] for x in range(4)]

# Apply different techniques to hide flag
parts[0] = codecs.decode(parts[0], 'rot_13')
parts[1] = to_atbash(parts[1])
parts[2] = base64.b64encode(parts[2].encode()).decode()
parts[3] = to_morse(parts[3])
```

To retrieve the original flag, we simply undo the encodings/ciphers

#### ROT_13

Since the alphabet is cyclic with length $13$, we simply apply ROT_13 on `part[0]` again

#### Atbash Cipher

Atbash is a **monoalphabetic** cipher, meaning each character in the plaintext has a one-to-one mapping in the ciphertext. We simply find the mapping and reverse it, to get the plaintext.

#### Base64 encoding

Base64 is an encoding that simply "translates" information from one form into another. We can use python's _base64_ library to decode it back to UTF-8.

#### Morse Code

Similar to Atbash, Morse Code is also a **monoalphabetic** cipher, hence we simply have to match each phrase to the original characters and join them together.

## Baby Math

### Description

We managed to steal some information about a secret flag. Can you piece it together to get the whole thing?

Files Provided:

- [source.py](/media/SCTF25/source5.py)

### Writeup

We are given a bunch of $(divisor, remainder)$ pairs of $flag$ and are tasked to recover it's original value.

First, we use [Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)](https://brilliant.org/wiki/chinese-remainder-theorem/) to recover some $x$ that fulfils the congruences we were given:

$$
\begin{align*}
    x & \equiv remainder_1 && (mod \space divisor_1) \\
    & \equiv remainder_2 && (mod \space divisor_2) \\
    & \equiv remainder_3 && (mod \space divisor_3) \\
    & \cdots \\
    & \equiv remainder_{17} && (mod \space divisor_{17}) \\
\end{align*}
$$

```python
def crt_implementation(divisors, remainders):
    product = 1
    for divisor in divisors:
        product *= divisor

    ans = 0
    for divisor, remainder in zip(divisors, remainders):
        ans += (product // divisor) * pow(product // divisor, -1, divisor) * remainder
        ans %= product
    
    for divisor, remainder in zip(divisors, remainders):
        assert ans % divisor == remainder
    
    return ans, product

divisors = [439429297, 107, 60586153, 509311637, 56196341, 587, 1061, 3096757, 59, 193, 3637, 130003, 37243, 1148339, 254899, 15140887, 1904537]
remainders = [319989397, 11, 3768949, 192286989, 6160298, 584, 830, 550668, 32, 181, 2842, 90486, 2658, 608727, 237542, 13861648, 862306]

rem, prod = crt_implementation(divisors, remainders)
```

Using CRT, we get the following equation
$$
flag \equiv rem \space (mod \space prod)
$$

This means that $flag = rem + k \cdot prod, k \in \mathbb{Z}$

We further notice that in [source.py](/media/SCTF25/source5.py), we are told that the flag has 39 characters, hence $flag$ only has at most 312 bits.

We check the number of bits that $prod$:

```python
print(prod.bit_length())
```

Since $prod$ only has at most 14 bits less than $flag$, we know that $k \le 2^{15}$ (otherwise, $k \cdot prod \gt 2 ^ {312}$).

We simply try all $2^{15}$ possible values of $k$ then check if the candidate value of $flag = rem + k \cdot prod$ starts with `sctf`. If it does, we print it out accordingly.

## picoCTF 2022 - bloat.py (modified)

### Description

Run the Python program bloat.py in the same directory as the encrypted flag, flag.txt.enc.

Files Provided:

- [bloat_files.zip](/media/SCTF25/bloat_files.zip)

### Writeup

On first impression, the code appears to be mildly obfuscated by creating a charset `a` and converting all strings into their individual characters, then representing each character as a particular index of `a`

```python
import sys
a = "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"+ \
            "[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~ "
def arg133(arg432):
  if arg432 == a[71]+a[64]+a[79]+a[79]+a[88]+a[66]+a[71]+a[64]+a[77]+a[66]+a[68]:
    return True
  else:
    print(a[51]+a[71]+a[64]+a[83]+a[94]+a[79]+a[64]+a[82]+a[82]+a[86]+a[78]+\
a[81]+a[67]+a[94]+a[72]+a[82]+a[94]+a[72]+a[77]+a[66]+a[78]+a[81]+\
a[81]+a[68]+a[66]+a[83])
    sys.exit(0)
    return False
def arg111(arg444):
  return arg122(arg444.decode(), a[81]+a[64]+a[79]+a[82]+a[66]+a[64]+a[75]+\
a[75]+a[72]+a[78]+a[77])
```

To make this more readable, we replace all of `a[idx]` with the literal string values, and join adjacent strings together. For instance, _'a'+'b'+'c'_ = _'abc'_. We can do this by deleting all _'+'_ strings to combine them together _'a'+'b'+'c'_ $\rightarrow$ _'a **'+'** b **'+'** c'_ $\rightarrow$ _'abc'_. A similar approach can be taken for adjacent strings separated by newlines.

My processing script can be found [here](/media/SCTF25/deobfuscate.py). After running it, we get [more readable code](/media/SCTF25/clean.py), albeit with meaningless names.

Next, we rename some of the variables and function names to better understand what the code is doing. After some renaming, I got [this](/media/SCTF25/renamed.py).

Reading the renamed code seems to suggest that the script takes in user input, checks if it matches the password and decrypts the flag for us if it matches:

```python
def check_password(password):
  if password == 'happychance':
    return True
  else:
    print('That password is incorrect')
    sys.exit(0)
    return False

# ... code in between

flag_bytes_enc = read_flag_bytes()
user_input = get_user_input()
check_password(user_input)
display()
arg423 = arg111(flag_bytes_enc)
```

It appears that the password is `happychance`. To find the flag, we simply run the script in the same directory as _flag.txt.enc_ and enter `happychance` as the password.

## picoCTF 2023 - timer

### Description

You will find the flag after analysing this apk. Note that specifically for this challenge, the flag is wrapped in picoCTF{...}

Files Provided:

- [timer.apk](/media/SCTF25/timer.apk)

### Writeup

A `.apk` file is pretty much just a zip file, hence we start by unzipping the file with Linux CLI:

```bash
unzip timer.apk -d unzipped
```

Next, we check if our `picoCTF` wrapper exists in any of the unzipped files:

```bash
cd unzipped
grep -rw picoCTF .
```

From the output, it appears that a match for the `picoCTF` string was found in `classes3.dex`. We simply use `strings` and `grep` to retrieve it:

```bash
strings -t x classes3.dex | grep picoCTF
```
